# Running queries on ComStock using AWS Athena

ComStock data can be accessed and downloaded using
[AWS Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/).
Here we will show how to query the data for multiple building types,
US regions, and upgrades.

## Requirements

An AWS account is necessary to run the code in this tutorial.

## Setting up AWS Athena with ComStock data for querying

First of all, we need to log into AWS and go to
[AWS Athena Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home).

NOTE: To run these queries, go to the `Query Editor` tab of the Athena
interface, copy and paste the query into the `New query` box, and click the
`Run query` button.

### Setting up the database
As a first step, we will create a database which the data we want to query
will live in - if you already have a database you want to create the tables
in, or are fine with the tables being created in a default database, skip
this step.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE comstock
```

### Creating the metadata table
Next we need to create the data tables that will be used to query the data.
We will create two tables, one with building characteristics and annual energy
data, and another with the time series energy data.

First we will create the metadata table, which will contain building
characteristics and annual energy data. This is query should take less than 1
minute to run.

In the SQL in the Athena `Query Editor` tab:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE `comstock_v1_metadata`(
  `applicability` boolean,
  `bldg_id` bigint,
  `climate_zone` string,
  `in.aspect_ratio` double,

The response from Athena when the command has successfully run should look
like this:

### Creating the time series table

Next we will create the timeseries table. This query can take anywhere from 1
minute to approximately 14 hours to run, so we advise starting this before bed!
The wide range depends on whether or not it has been run recently by someone
else, in which case AWS appears to use a cache rather than redoing things.

You will likely be logged out of AWS while waiting for this to complete. To
check on if the query has completed click on the **History** tab next in the
Athena GUI and look for the query that begins
`CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE comstock_v1_state(`
\- when the query updates from running to completed you will know you are ready
to proceed to the next step.

![CreateTable](https://github.com/NREL/ComStock/blob/cbianchi/documentation/documentation/Screen%20Shot%202021-04-15%20at%2011.03.03%20AM.png?raw=true)

### Establishing partitions on the time series table

We use partitions to make our queries against the time series table quicker
and more cost efficient. By splitting up the table by `state` and `upgrade`
average query time decreases by ~48X and cost by even more. This works by
having Athena mark which folders in S3 contain data relevant to each of the
possible values for `state` or `upgrade`, and then only access those folders
when the relevant value is requested. Guaranteeing that the partitions are all
correctly instantiated one last query, which should take between one and four
hours to complete:

```sql
MSCK REPAIR TABLE comstock_v1_state
```

Once again, you may need to use the **History** tab in the Athena GUI to check
when this command completes.

## Running queries against ComStock

Now that the tables have been created, we can query the data through Athena.

### Core example query

Let's start with an example of a query that uses the metadata table and time
series table to retrieve hourly data from a subset of the building simulations.
In this example we'll get all available end-uses for a Medium Office in
Wisconsin for the baseline case (no upgrade has been applied).

To download the returned data as a CSV file click the file icon highlighted in
red in the screenshot above.

Now let's demonstrate so ways of changing up the query:

### How to query data for other building types?

All we have to do for this is change the following line in the `WHERE` clause
in the example query:

```sql
    AND "comstock_v1_metadata"."in.building_type" = 'MediumOffice'
```

Instead of 'MediumOffice' we can use one any of the following building types:

'MediumOffice', 'LargeOffice', 'SecondarySchool', 'Hospital','Outpatient'

### How to query other states?

All we have to do for this is change the following line in the `WHERE` clause
in the example query:

```sql
    AND "comstock_v1_state"."state" IN ('55')
```

Instead of '55' (Wisconsin) we can use the FIPS code for another state, as
listed here:
https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/?cid=nrcs143_013696

### How to query an upgrade?

All we have to do for this is change the following lines in the `WHERE` clause
in the example query:

```sql
    AND "comstock_v1_state"."upgrade" = 0
    AND "comstock_v1_metadata"."upgrade" = 0
```

Instead of '0' we can use one of the following options:
```
0: Baseline,
1: Upgrade Roof Insulation (R-19)
2: Upgrade Roof Insulation (R-30)
3: Upgrade Wall Insulation (R-13)
4: Upgrade Wall Insulation (R-30)
7: Add Window Film
8: Add Cool Roof
9: Add EIFS Wall Insulation
10: Add Electrochromic Windows (BleachedGlass)
11: Add Electrochromic Windows (TintedGlass)

### How to change time resolution?

1. For changing the resolution to 15 minutes, all we have to do is modifying
   the lines just before the `FROM` clause in the example query above as
   follows:

```sql
    month(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    ) AS "month",
    day(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    ) AS "day",
    hour(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    ) AS "hour"
    minute(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    ) AS "minute"
    FROM
```

And then in the `GROUP BY` clause:

```sql
    GROUP BY
    "comstock_v1_metadata"."state",
    "comstock_v1_state"."upgrade",
    month(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    ),
    day(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    ),
    hour(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    )
    minute(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    )
```
And finally in the `ORDER BY` clause:
```sql
    ORDER BY
    "comstock_v1_metadata"."state",
    "comstock_v1_state"."upgrade",
    month(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    ),
    day(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    ),
    hour(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    )
    minute(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    )
```

2. For changing the resolution to 1 day, all we have to do is modifying the
   lines just before the `FROM` clause in the example query above as follows:

```sql
    month(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    ) AS "month",
    day(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    ) AS "day"
    FROM
```

And then in the `GROUP BY` clause:

```sql
    GROUP BY
    "comstock_v1_metadata"."state",
    "comstock_v1_state"."upgrade",
    month(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    ),
    day(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    )
```
And finally in the `ORDER BY` clause:
```sql
    ORDER BY
    "comstock_v1_metadata"."state",
    "comstock_v1_state"."upgrade",
    month(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    ),
    day(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    )
```

3. For changing the resolution to 1 month, all we have to do is modifying the
   lines just before the `FROM` clause in the example query above as follows:

```sql
    month(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    ) AS "month"
    FROM
```

And then in the `GROUP BY` clause:

```sql
    GROUP BY
    "comstock_v1_metadata"."state",
    "comstock_v1_state"."upgrade",
    month(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    )
```
And finally in the `ORDER BY` clause:
```sql
    ORDER BY
    "comstock_v1_metadata"."state",
    "comstock_v1_state"."upgrade",
    month(
    "comstock_v1_state"."timestamp"
    )
```

### How to average data rather than sums?

All we have to do for this is change the modify part in everythome it appears
in the `SELECT` clause:

```sql
    sum(
```

It has to be changed with:
```sql
    avg(
```

### How to preview the table to see all available columns?

All we have to do for this is change the example query above with
what follows:

```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM
      "comstock_v1_state",
      "comstock_v1_metadata"
    WHERE
      "comstock_v1_state"."bldg_id" = "comstock_v1_metadata"."bldg_id"
    limit 10
```

This will show ten rows of data from all columns in the joined datasets.
